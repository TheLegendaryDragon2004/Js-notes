# Episode 10 : Closures in JS

- Function bundled along with it's lexical scope is **closure**.

- JavaScript has a lexcial scope environment. If a function needs to access a variable, it first goes to its local memory. When it does not find it there, it goes to the memory of its lexical parent. See Below code, Over here function **y** along with its lexical scope i.e. (function x) would be called a closure.

  ```js
  function x() {
    var a = 7;
    function y() {
      console.log(a);
    }
    return y;
  }
  var z = x();
  console.log(z); // value of z is entire code of function y.
  console.log(z()); //By default, a function with no return gives undefined.
  ```

  - In above code, When y is returned, not only is the function returned but the entire closure (fun y + its lexical scope) is returned and put inside z. So when z is used somewhere else in program, it still remembers var a inside x()

- Another Example

```js
function z() {
  var b = 900;
  function x() {
    var a = 7;
    function y() {
      console.log(a, b);
    }
    y();
  }
  x();
}
z(); // 7 900
```

- Thus In simple words, we can say:
  - **\*A closure is a function** that has access to its outer function scope even after the function has returned. Meaning, A closure can remember and access variables and arguments reference of its outer function even after the function has returned.\*

```js
function greetLater() {
  let name = "Vinayak";

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("Hello " + name); // <-- closure: remembers "name"
  }, 2000);
}

greetLater();

```

A closure is any function that remembers variables from its outer scope. It doesnâ€™t need to be returned â€” it just has to exist inside another function and use outer variables.

* Advantages of Closure:

      Certainly! Let's explore examples for each of the advantages you've
      mentioned:

  1.  **Module Design Pattern**:

      - The module design pattern allows us to encapsulate related
        functionality into a single module or file. It helps organize
        code, prevent global namespace pollution, and promotes
        reusability.
      - Example: Suppose we're building a web application, and we want
        to create a module for handling user authentication. We can
        create a `auth.js` module that exports functions like `login`,
        `logout`, and `getUserInfo`.

        ```js
        // auth.js
        const authModule = (function () {
          let loggedInUser = null;

          function login(username, password) {
            // Authenticate user logic...
            loggedInUser = username;
          }

          function logout() {
            loggedInUser = null;
          }

          function getUserInfo() {
            return loggedInUser;
          }

          return {
            login,
            logout,
            getUserInfo,
          };
        })();

        // Usage
        authModule.login("john_doe", "secret");
        console.log(authModule.getUserInfo()); // 'john_doe'
        ```

  2.  **Currying**:

      - Currying is a technique where a function that takes multiple
        arguments is transformed into a series of functions that take
        one argument each. It enables partial function application and
        enhances code flexibility.
      - Example: Let's create a curried function to calculate the total
        price of items with tax.

        ```js
        const calculateTotalPrice = (taxRate) => (price) =>
          price + price * (taxRate / 100);

        const calculateSalesTax = calculateTotalPrice(8); // 8% sales tax
        const totalPrice = calculateSalesTax(100); // Price with tax
        console.log(totalPrice); // 108
        ```

  3.  **Memoization**:

      - Memoization optimizes expensive function calls by caching their
        results. It's useful for recursive or repetitive computations.
      - Example: Implement a memoized Fibonacci function.

        ```js
        function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
          if (n in memo) return memo[n];
          if (n <= 1) return n;

          memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
          return memo[n];
        }

        console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 55
        ```

  4.  **Data Hiding and Encapsulation**:

      - Encapsulation hides the internal details of an object and
        exposes only necessary methods and properties. It improves code
        maintainability and security.
      - Example: Create a `Person` class with private properties.

        ```js
        class Person {
          #name; // Private field

          constructor(name) {
            this.#name = name;
          }

          getName() {
            return this.#name;
          }
        }

        const person = new Person("Alice");
        console.log(person.getName()); // 'Alice'
        // console.log(person.#name); // Error: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
        ```

  5.  **setTimeouts**:

      - `setTimeout` allows scheduling a function to run after a
        specified delay. It's commonly used for asynchronous tasks,
        animations, and event handling.
      - Example: Delayed message display.

        ```js
        function showMessage(message, delay) {
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(message);
          }, delay);
        }

        showMessage("Hello, world!", 2000); // Display after 2 seconds
        ```

  These examples demonstrate the power and versatility of closures in
  JavaScript! ðŸš€

**Disadvantages of Closure:**

1.**overconsumption of memory**

Normally, when a function finishes, all its local variables are garbage collected (freed from memory).

But in a closure, the inner function still remembers variables from the outer function, even after the outer function has finished.

This means variables that are no longer needed might still be stored in memory.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```js
function bigClosure() {
  let bigArray = new Array(1000000).fill("data"); // huge array
  return function() {
    console.log(bigArray[0]);
  }
}
const keep = bigClosure(); // bigArray stays in memory
```


Here, bigArray never gets freed because the inner function is still referencing it.

ðŸ”¹ 2. **Memory Leaks**

If closures keep referencing variables or DOM elements that are no longer needed, they prevent garbage collection.

This is called a memory leak â€” memory that canâ€™t be reclaimed.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```js
function attachEvent() {
  let element = document.getElementById("btn");
  element.addEventListener("click", function() {
    console.log(element.id);
  });
}
attachEvent();
```


Even if you remove the button from the DOM, the closure still holds a reference to element, so it wonâ€™t be garbage collected â†’ memory leak.

ðŸ”¹ 3. **Freeze / Slow Browser**

If a closure accidentally traps a large object or keeps growing (like appending data to an array in memory), your browserâ€™s memory usage can explode.

Too much memory usage makes the browser slow, and in worst cases, it freezes.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```js
function badClosure() {
  let growing = [];
  return function(data) {
    growing.push(data); // keeps growing, never released
  }
}
const add = badClosure();
setInterval(() => add("leak"), 1); // will eventually freeze browser
```
